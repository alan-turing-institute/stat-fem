Overview

The Finite Element Method (FEM) provides a powerful set of tools to enable the
approximate solution to partial differential equations by approximating
the solution as the solution to a set of algebraic equations. It is a
powerful method of analysis in a wide range of scientific fields. However,
the computational methods of the classic FEM do not lend itself well
to integrating observational data into the solution method, and instead
scientists usually resort to less formal methods such as trial and error
in order to find agreement between data and models.

An alternative approach is to re-formulate the FEM problem as a Bayesian
inference problem, and then condition the FEM solution on the observational
data at known points. This apprach is referred to as the Statistical Finite
Element Method, and the ``stat-fem`` library provides a software library
to carry out these inference problems.
