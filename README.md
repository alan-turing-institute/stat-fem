## Overview

This package provides a Python implementation of the Statistical Finite Element Method (FEM) as
described in the paper by Girolami et al. [1] to use data observations to constrain
FEM models. The package builds on top of Firedrake [2] to assemble the underlying FEM system
and uses PETSc [3-4] to perform the sparse linear algebra routines. These tools should allow
the user to create efficient, scalable solvers based on high level Python code to address
challenging problems in data-driven numerical analysis.

## Installation

### Installing stat-fem

`stat-fem` requires a working Firedrake installation. The easiest way
to obtain Firedrake is to use the installation script provided by the
Firedrake project on the [firedrake homepage](https://www.firedrakeproject.org).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/master/scripts/firedrake-install
python3 firedrake-install --install git+https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/stat-fem#egg=stat-fem
```

This will install Firedrake and install the `stat-fem` library inside the
Firedrake virtual environment. If this does not work, details on manual
installation are provided in the [documentation](https://stat-fem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/installation.html).

### Using a Docker Container

Alternatively, we provide a working Firedrake Docker container that has the `stat-fem` code
and dependencies installed within the Firedrake virtual environment. See the `docker`
directory in the `stat-fem` repository.

### Testing the installation

The code comes with a full suite of unit tests. Running the test suite uses pytest and pytest-mpi
to collect and run the tests. To run the tests on a single process, simply enter `pytest` into
the running virtual environment from any location in the stat-fem directory. To run the test
suite in parallel, enter `mpiexec -n 2 python -m pytest --with-mpi` or
`mpiexec -n 4 python -m pytest --with-mpi` depending on the number of desired
processes to be used. Tests have only been written for 2 and 4 processes, so
you may get a failure if you attempt to use other choices for the number
of processes.

## Example Scripts

An example illustrating the various code capabilities and features is included in
the `stat-fem/examples` directory.

## Contact

This software was written by Eric Daub as part of a project with the Research Engineering Group at the
Alan Turing Institute.

Any bugs or issues should be filed in the issue tracker on the main Github page.
